<b>A complete QTE System based on a single script : `QTE.cs` which handles all needed to insert a QTE system in your game.</b>

<h1> More to come.. </h1>
<b>Handier system to manage the QTE system with some kind of Unity Editor stuff.</b>
<b>More additionnal stuff that makes the QTEs even better ! eg: colors, animations, hover before pressing, spamming buttons, hold buttons etc </b>
